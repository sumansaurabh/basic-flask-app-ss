# Basic Flask App

This small repo demonstrates a proper file structure for a Flask app. The folders named *static* and *templates* are required.

**Routes** and **static files** are handled correctly in all `src` and `href` attributes in the template files.

After installing all dependencies, run the app by entering its folder and typing:

`$ python routes.py <port-no>` to run the server

`chmod +x kill_process.sh`

`sh run.sh` - Currently, it will run the four flask server on port [5001 to 5003]

To kill all the flask server
`./kill_process.sh` - will kill all the above flask server
